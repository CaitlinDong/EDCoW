ECLIPSE PROJECT

------- Based on the paper 'Event Detection in Twitter' by Jianshu Weng, Bu-Sung Lee ICWSM 2011--------
************** Event Detection With CLustering of Wavelet-based Signals *********************
***********************************   EDCoW   ***********************************************

Thanks to the great help from our tutors, Adrien Guille and Jairo Cugliari, We are achieving this project as fruit of our case study for the second semester, 
Master 1 of DMKM, Université Lumière - Lyon2, 2003-2004. Developped by Yue He and Falitokiniaina Rabearison.

REMARK 1:
If debug mode is enabled, some output files will be stored:
* The form of the path of the autocorrelation file is
	./results/folderName_window_delta_AutoCorrVal.csv
	
* File containing the remaining keywords after filtering with theta1
	FolderName_window_delta_gama1_theta1__RemainKeyWords.txt	
	
* Put OriginalBigMatrix in a file	
	./results/FolderName_window_delta_gamma1_theta1_theta2_OriginalBigMatrix.csv
	
* Filter OriginalBigMatrix with theta2 & Put FilteredBigMatrix in a file
	./results/FolderName_window_delta_gamma1_gamm2_theta1_theta2_FilteredBigMatrix.csv
	
REMARK 2:	
We change the code : make gamma to be different
	gamma1 for theta1
	gamma2 for theta2
	
REMARK 3:
All the needed files to be added to the build path are in the folder.

REMARK 4:
You can find documentation of the code in the folder doc.
